## UX

### 80`s video games?
My website is prepared to acknowledge the young generation about video games from an era without www.
Most of them never heard of any gaming devices before XBOX and Playstation. '80s are trendy now, so I thought that I could help the new generation to understand how it was.
This website is made as well as a nostalgic journey for those who had a chance to play with Atari games when they were kids.

### Let`s go back!

On my website user can find out a little bit about Atari. there is a text section explaining subject with plus button attached linked to Youtube channel where subject is explained wider.
The same with Asteroids game. On my websiet you can find a short hint but hsitory of a game but attached link to wkipedia saying more about this matter.
