## UX

### 80`s video games?
My website is prepared to acknowledge ypung generation about video games from era without www.
Most of them never heard of any devices with game taht you could connect to tv or mini computer that could give you hours spending relaxing and having fun compeeting with friens.
This website is made as well as a nostalgic journey for those who had a chance to play with Atari games when the were kids.
